Notes from the various docs

[A Gentle Introduction to Bitcoin Core Development](https://bitcointechtalk.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-bitcoin-core-development-fdc95eaee6b8)

Git - If you're testing someone else's code you should know how to add multiple repos to your local dev environment so you can fetch and test the code

Packages - how to [install and remove packages](http://www.control-escape.com/linux/lx-swinstall.html) on your platform

Building from source - git clone, set up your dev environment

Compiling is something you'll need to do frequently

Run all the integration tests, turn on the GUI and ZMQ

Unit tests are compiled with everything else so just run the binary that results

Run the extended integration tests. Pruning test takes a long time so exclude that test

To test you will need to download the code from the pull request, compile again and run the tests
